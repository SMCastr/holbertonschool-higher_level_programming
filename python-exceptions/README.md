## Project Overview

In this project, you'll work on various Python functions, each addressing a specific exception-handling scenario. The project is designed to help you become proficient in:

- Using try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
- Raising custom exceptions with specific messages.
- Performing safe operations that prevent unexpected crashes in your code.

## Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

1. **Safe list printing:** Write a function to print elements of a list safely, even when the list is shorter than the specified number of elements.

2. **Safe printing of an integers list:** Create a function to print integers, and handle non-integer input gracefully.

3. **Print and count integers:** Write a function to print and count integers in a list, ignoring other types.

4. **Integers division with debug:** Develop a function to divide two integers, with debugging information for exceptions.

5. **Divide a list:** Implement a function to divide elements of two lists, handling various exceptions and producing a new list of results.

6. **Raise exception:** Create a function to explicitly raise a type exception.

7. **Raise a message:** Write a function to raise a name exception with a custom message.
