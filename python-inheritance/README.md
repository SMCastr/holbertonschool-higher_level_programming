# Python Inheritance

This project is focuses on the concept of inheritance in Python. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, allowing classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes, facilitating code reusability and organization.

## General Info

In this project, we explore the following topics related to Python inheritance:

- Creating custom classes and subclasses.
- Defining class methods and attributes.
- Overriding methods and attributes.
- Using built-in functions like `isinstance` and `issubclass` for type checking.

## Technologies

- Python 3.8.5

## Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

1. **Lookup**: Write a function that returns a list of available attributes and methods of an object.

2. **My List**: Create a class `MyList` that inherits from the `list` class and adds a method to print the list in ascending order.

3. **Exact Same Object**: Write a function that checks if an object is exactly an instance of a specified class.

4. **Same Class or Inherit From**: Create a function that checks if an object is an instance of, or inherits from, a specified class.

5. **Geometry Module**: Define an empty class called `BaseGeometry`.

6. **Improve Geometry**: Improve the `BaseGeometry` class by adding an `area` method that raises an exception.

7. **Integer Validator**: Extend the `BaseGeometry` class with an `integer_validator` method for validating integer values.

8. **Rectangle**: Create a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` and represents rectangles with width and height.

9. **Full Rectangle**: Extend the `Rectangle` class by adding an `area` method and a `__str__` method for better representation.

10. **Square #1**: Define a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` for creating squares.

11. **Square #2**: Extend the `Square` class by adding a `__str__` method for improved string representation.

## Code Explanation

- Each Python file is well-documented, explaining the purpose and functionality of the classes, functions, and methods.
- Code comments and docstrings are used to provide clarity and help understand the code.

## Tests

- The project includes text files in the `tests` folder for each Python file (extension: .txt).
- These test files are used for doctesting to verify the correctness of the code.
