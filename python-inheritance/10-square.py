import sys
from warnings import showwarning
sys.path.append('/path/to/rectangle/module')

pip3 showwarning rectangle
    ```

    This will show you information about the `rectangle` module, including its version and installation location.

2. If the module is installed, check that the path to the module is correct. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    python3 -c "import rectangle; print(rectangle.__file__)"
    ```

    This will print the path of the `rectangle` module. You can then update the path in the code accordingly.

3. If the path is correct and the module exists, you can try adding the path to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/rectangle/module
    ```

    This will add the path to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, which tells Python where to look for modules.

Here's the updated code:


class Square_one(Rectangle):

    def __init__(self, size):
        # Call the __init__ method of the Rectangle class with size as both width and height
        # Validate the size argument using the integer_validator method
        super().__init__(size, size)
        self.integer_validator("size", size)
        self.__size = size

    def area(self):
        # Implement the area method to return the area of the square
        return self.__size ** 2
