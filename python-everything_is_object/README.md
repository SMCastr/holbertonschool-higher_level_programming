# Python - Everything is Object

This project delves into the fundamental concept that "everything is an object" in Python. It explores Python's treatment of different types of objects, the distinction between mutable and immutable objects, and how Python handles variable assignment and function argument passing. This project is designed to help you develop a deep understanding of these core concepts in Python, which are often assessed in interviews for Python positions.

## Project Description

The project comprises a series of tasks and questions that challenge your understanding of Python's object-oriented nature. It includes tasks related to mutable and immutable objects, variable identity, and function argument passing.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the following:

- What is an object
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- The difference between immutable and mutable objects
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- Built-in mutable and immutable types
- How Python passes variables to functions

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### .txt Answer Files

- Only one line
- No Shebang on the first line (i.e., `#!/usr/bin/python3`)
- All your files should end with a new line

## Tasks

The project consists of multiple tasks that assess your understanding of Python's object-oriented concepts. Each task has its own requirements and a corresponding `.txt` answer file.

## Blog Post

As part of the project, you are required to write a blog post that summarizes and explains the core concepts covered in the project. The blog post should be structured to cover the following topics:

- Introduction
- ID and Type
- Mutable Objects
- Immutable Objects
- Why Does It Matter and How Python Treats Mutable and Immutable Objects Differently
- How Arguments Are Passed to Functions and Its Implications
- (Optional) Insights from Advanced Tasks
