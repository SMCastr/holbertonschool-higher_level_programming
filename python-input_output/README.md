# Python Input and Output

This repository contains Python programs that demonstrate various input and output operations, including file handling, JSON serialization, and Pascal's Triangle generation.

## Files

- **0-read_file.py**: A Python script that reads a text file and prints its content to the standard output.

- **1-number_of_lines.py**: A Python script that counts the number of lines in a text file.

- **2-read_lines.py**: A Python script that reads `n` lines from a text file and prints them to the standard output.

- **3-write_file.py**: A Python script that writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.

- **4-append_write.py**: A Python script that appends a string to the end of a text file.

- **5-save_to_json_file.py**: A Python script that saves a Python object to a JSON file.

- **6-load_from_json_file.py**: A Python script that loads a Python object from a JSON file.

- **7-add_item.py**: A Python script that adds all arguments to a Python list and saves the list to a file.

- **8-class_to_json.py**: A Python script that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer, and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object.

- **9-student.py**: A Python class `Student` that defines a student with attributes and methods for JSON serialization and deserialization.

- **10-student.py**: An extension of the `Student` class with a `to_json` method.

- **11-student.py**: An extension of the `Student` class with a `reload_from_json` method.

- **12-pascal_triangle.py**: A Python function `pascal_triangle` that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## How to Run

To run the Python scripts, you can use the following format:

```bash
$ python script_name.py
