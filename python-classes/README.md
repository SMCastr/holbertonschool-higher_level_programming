# Square Class

This repository contains a Python class `Square` that defines a square and includes various functionalities and attribute validations.

## Task List

1. **Task 0: My first square**
   - An empty `Square` class definition.

2. **Task 1: Square with size**
   - A `Square` class with a private instance attribute `size` and an `__init__` method.

3. **Task 2: Size validation**
   - A `Square` class with size validation in the `__init__` method.

4. **Task 3: Area of a square**
   - A `Square` class with a public `area` method that calculates the square's area.

5. **Task 4: Access and update private attribute**
   - A `Square` class with a private attribute `size` and getter/setter methods for size validation.

6. **Task 5: Printing a square**
   - A `Square` class with a method `my_print` for printing a square using "#" characters.

7. **Task 6: Coordinates of a square**
   - A `Square` class with size, position, and a method `my_print` that considers position for printing.

## Usage

To use the `Square` class, you can create instances of the class and interact with its methods and attributes.

Example:

```python
# Create a square with size 3
my_square = Square(3)

# Get the area of the square
area = my_square.area()
print("Area:", area)

# Change the size
my_square.size = 5

# Print the square
my_square.my_print()
```
