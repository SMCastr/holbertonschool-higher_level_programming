# Python Import & Modules Project

by: Sweety

This project consists of Python scripts that demonstrate various aspects of importing modules and using functions from external files. Each script addresses specific requirements and learning objectives related to Python programming.

## Project Files

1. **0-add.py**
   - Imports the `add` function from the file `add_0.py`.
   - Demonstrates how to use imported functions.
   - Prints the result of adding 1 + 2.

2. **1-calculation.py**
   - Imports functions (add, sub, mul, div) from the file `calculator_1.py`.
   - Performs various mathematical operations using the imported functions.
   - Prints the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. **2-args.py**
   - Prints the number of command-line arguments passed to the script.
   - Lists the arguments with their positions.

4. **3-infinite_add.py**
   - Calculates the sum of all command-line arguments (assumes they can be casted into integers).
   - Prints the result of the addition.

5. **4-hidden_discovery.py**
   - Imports and inspects the module `hidden_4.pyc`.
   - Prints the names defined in the module that do not start with double underscores.

6. **5-variable_load.py**
   - Imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py`.
   - Prints the value of the imported variable.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Scripts should be executable.
- Scripts should not be executed when imported.
- Follow the specific instructions for each script as mentioned in the project description.

## Usage

To run each script, use the following format in the terminal:

```bash
./script_name.py
