# Python - More Classes and Objects

This repository contains a set of Python scripts that implement various features related to classes and objects. Each script corresponds to a specific task, and they build upon each other to demonstrate different aspects of object-oriented programming in Python.

Here is a brief description of each task and the corresponding Python file:

## 0-rectangle.py

Defines an empty class `Rectangle` that represents a rectangle.

## 1-rectangle.py

Adds attributes for width and height to the `Rectangle` class with setter and getter methods for validation.

## 2-rectangle.py

Enhances the `Rectangle` class by adding methods to calculate its area and perimeter.

## 3-rectangle.py

Improves the `Rectangle` class with `__str__` and `__repr__` methods to provide string representation.

## 4-rectangle.py

Extends the `Rectangle` class to support representation using `eval()` and adds a deletion message.

## 5-rectangle.py

Adds functionality to detect when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted and prints a corresponding message.

## 6-rectangle.py

Introduces a class attribute `number_of_instances` to count the number of instances and adds class methods for counting and printing instance count.

## 7-rectangle.py

Expands the `Rectangle` class with the option to set a custom symbol for representation.

## 8-rectangle.py

Adds a static method to compare two rectangles and return the one with the greater area.

## 9-rectangle.py

Introduces a class method to create a square `Rectangle` with equal width and height.

Each script provides a self-contained implementation for its respective task and can be used as a standalone module or combined with the other tasks to build more complex applications involving rectangles.
