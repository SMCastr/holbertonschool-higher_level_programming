# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to the Python Practice Repository! This repository contains a variety of Python exercises and projects designed to help you improve your Python programming skills. The exercises are organized into three main folders:

## python-hello_world

The `python-hello_world` folder is your starting point for mastering basic Python syntax and programming concepts. Here, you will find exercises that cover topics such as printing, string manipulation, and basic data types. The exercises in this folder include:

- `2-print.py`: A simple script that prints a specific string to the console.
- `3-print_number.py`: A script that prints a specific number to the console.
- `4-print_float.py`: A script that prints a specific floating-point number.
- `5-print_string.py`: A script that prints a string with special characters.
- `6-concat.py`: A script that demonstrates string concatenation.
- `7-edges.py`: A script that prints specific substrings of a string.
- `8-concat_edges.py`: A script that concatenates specific substrings of two strings.
- `9-easter_egg.py`: A script that adds a fun Easter egg to your console output.

## python-if_else_loops_functions

The `python-if_else_loops_functions` folder focuses on control flow statements, loops, and functions in Python. These exercises will help you understand and practice conditional logic, loops, and creating and using functions. The exercises in this folder include:

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: A script that generates a random number and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.py`: A script that analyzes the last digit of a random number.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A script that prints the lowercase alphabet using a loop.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A script that prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding "q" and "e."
- `4-print_hexa.py`: A script that prints numbers in decimal and hexadecimal format.
- `5-print_comb2.py`: A script that prints all possible combinations of two digits.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: A script that prints all possible combinations of three digits.
- And more!

## python-import_modules

The `python-import_modules` folder introduces you to the world of Python modules. You'll learn how to import and use external modules in your Python programs. The exercises in this folder include:

- `0-add.py`: A script that imports a function from the `add-0` module to perform addition.
- `1-calculation.py`: A script that uses functions from a module to perform various calculations.
- `2-args.py`: A script that demonstrates accessing command-line arguments using the `sys` module.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: A script that adds any number of positive integers passed as arguments.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: A script that lists all module names excluding those that start with double underscores.
- And more!

## python-data_structures

The `python-data_structures` folder explores data structures in Python, including lists, strings, tuples, and more. You'll learn how to manipulate and work with these data structures effectively. The exercises in this folder include:

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: A script that prints all integers in a list.
- `1-element_at.py`: A function that retrieves an element from a list.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: A script that prints integers in a list in reverse order.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: A function that replaces an element in a list without modifying the original.
- And more!
